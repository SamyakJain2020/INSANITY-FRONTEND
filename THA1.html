Kindly supply the books by next week. Also, please make sure that the books are in good condition and arrive undamaged.

I request you to send the bill along with the books after applying the discount permissible to schools. Payment will be made soon after the receipt and checking of the books.

Damaged books will not be accepted nor any payment will be made for the same.

We seek your cooperation in this regard.
